## Values

Before getting started it's important to understand the ethos behind these proposed guidelines and what is expected from developers to adhere to them.

**Self-sufficiency & Learning**  
All of the tools and processes we use are exhasutively documented in this repository and on the Internet. Developers are expected to get answers to most of their questions via those resources. If you need to ask someone else for help you should be able to clearly describe the steps you have taken to answer your own question, and where those steps failed to lead you to the solution.

**Collaboration**  
Collaboration is important here for several reasons. First, developers can gain valuable insights by having other developers with different experiences review their work. Additionally, peer reviews during the development process will make it much easier for future developers to maintain legacy apps. Many of us have had to inherit someone else's code due to retirement, sickness, vacation, or other unexpected events. Peer reviews can ensure that what's inherited is easy to understand.

**Sustainability**
