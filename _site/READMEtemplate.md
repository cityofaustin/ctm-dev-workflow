# Project Title

What is this? Why does it exist? Who uses it?

## Quick Start

How would another developer get up and running? Do they need access to other services? Do they need to download something other than the repo? Other dependencies? Are there potential version/compatibility dependencies they should be worried about?

## Environments

### Production

- **URL:** [prod.com]() 
- **GitHub:** `master`
- **Deployment:** Notes about deployment such as CI

### Test

- **URL:** [test.com]() 
- **GitHub:** `test`
- **Description:** This branch maintains a close database sync with `Production` and is used for customer testing and confirmation of changes ahead of a merge into `master`.

### Dev

- **URL:** [dev.com]() 
- **GitHub:** `dev`
- **Description:** This is a testing server for work-in-progress. The server does not have the same level of database permissions as `test` and `production`.

### Local

- **URL:** [http://localhost/]() 
- **GitHub:** `mt-bonnell`
- **Description:** Notes about working locally. VPN required? Cache clearing? SASS updating?

## Contributing

Are there any project-specific guidelines around contributing? Should Pull Requests be assigned to a particular team member? Do developers need to explicitly request Write access?
