# GitHub

We use GitHub for version control and developer collaboration. Some projects also use GitHub's *Issues* feature for issue reporting and tracking.

Historically, most GitHub work has been done in the on-prem installation at [GitHub.austintexas.gov](http://github.austintexas.gov)<sup>1</sup> . More recently, however, many teams are using [GitHub.com](https://github.com/cityofaustin) directly.
