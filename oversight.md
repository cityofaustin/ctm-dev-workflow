# Proposed steps for ensuring adherence to development best practices

1. Set all `master` branches as *protected* in branch Settings.

   1. Developers must assign a PR to a Reviewer.

   2. Reviewer completes the following:

      1. Conduct standard code review
      2. Confirm clean commit history
      3. Check for sufficiently-descriptive commit messages
   3. Reviewer & Developer might have several rounds of commit updates and requests.
   4. Once Reviewer marks the branch as OK the Pull Request should be assigned to a Manager with merge-level authority. The Manager is the final step in making sure the Pull Request & associated Commits adhere to our new development standards.
2. Conduct in-person process training through a collaborative coding exercise. (This will take some time to design and structure, and would be much more effective if done in context of an actual project)
