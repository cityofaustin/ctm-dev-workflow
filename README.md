# Application Development Workflow

This repo is a collaboration and publishing space for the CTM Application Development workflow. For now the guides will live here as markdown files but might evolve to be part of a broader documentation site, akin to [18F's Guides](https://guides.18f.gov).

The documents are written with a formatting syntax called *markdown*, which is used by sites like Reddit, Trello, and SiteLeaf to allow content writers to invoke HTML elements using basic text characters.  GitHub and other hosting environments support a markdown superset called *kramdown* that allows for even greater utility. The [kramdown Quick Reference Guide](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) is a great starting point for familiarizing yourself with the syntax and its capabilities.

If you don't have a preferred markdown editor I recommend [Typora](https://typora.io) (Mac, Windows, Linux).
