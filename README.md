# CoA Application Development Policies and Practices

Guides published at https://cityofaustin.github.io/ctm-dev-workflow/

This repo is a collaboration and publishing space for the CTM Application Development workflow. CoA software and web developers are encouraged to read the documentation and sign up for in-person training to learn how to incorporate the workflow into their daily work.

For now the guides will live here as markdown files but might evolve to be part of a broader documentation site, akin to [18F's Guides](https://guides.18f.gov).

This repo just consists of markdown files, so no further setup guide is required. You can edit the static markdown files in your feature branch 

The documents are written with a formatting syntax called *markdown*, which is used by sites like Reddit, Trello, and SiteLeaf to allow content writers to invoke HTML elements using basic text characters.  GitHub and other hosting environments support a markdown superset called *kramdown* that allows for even greater utility. The [kramdown Quick Reference Guide](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) is a great starting point for familiarizing yourself with the syntax and its capabilities.

If you don't have a preferred markdown editor I recommend [Typora](https://typora.io).
